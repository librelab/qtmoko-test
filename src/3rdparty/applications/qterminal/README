This is a Qtopia Terminal Console app.
Source code is taken from KDE4 Konsole for the gui part (is partial not the whole functionality has been ported, and I'm not really sure many is needed on a PXA device anyway ).
The Pty backend for now it comes from the opie-console as Konsole is still using the K3Process, and I don't quite understand how this ptys and dup of stdin are working :) in QProcess ...

LICENSE: GPL v2 or superior (I think)

DONE: 
Profiles are somehow handled now... (qterminal.conf and colorscheme + keytab
Colors and Keyboards should work

TODO:
Plenty I think, but the app seems to be usable
Profiles

BIG NOTE:
there needs to be a dejavu-mono font on the destination device, or at least some fixed font, as the default condensed is misshandled.
probably adding  would do the job
-font dejavu_mono:9,10,12

If anyone who reads this file knows how to force this setting into the pro file,drop in a line.

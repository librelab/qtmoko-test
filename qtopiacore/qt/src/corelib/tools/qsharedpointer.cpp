    \class QSharedPointer
    \brief The QSharedPointer class holds a strong reference to a shared pointer
    \since 4.5

    \reentrant
    \ingroup misc

    The QSharedPointer is an automatic, shared pointer in C++. It
    behaves exactly like a normal pointer for normal purposes,
    including respect for constness.

    QSharedPointer will delete the pointer it is holding when it goes
    out of scope, provided no other QSharedPointer objects are
    referencing it.

    A QSharedPointer object can be created from a normal pointer,
    another QSharedPointer object or by promoting a
    QWeakPointer object to a strong reference.

    \section1 Thread-Safety

    QSharedPointer and QWeakPointer are thread-safe and operate
    atomically on the pointer value. Different threads can also access
    the same QSharedPointer or QWeakPointer object at the same time
    without need for locking mechanisms.

    It should be noted that, while the pointer value can be accessed
    in this manner, QSharedPointer and QWeakPointer provide no
    guarantee about the object being pointed to. Thread-safety and
    reentrancy rules for that object still apply.

    \section1 Other Pointer Classes

    Qt also provides two other pointer wrapper classes: QPointer and
    QSharedDataPointer. They are incompatible with one another, since
    each has its very different use case.

    QSharedPointer holds a shared pointer by means of an external
    reference count (i.e., a reference counter placed outside the
    object). Like its name indicates, the pointer value is shared
    among all instances of QSharedPointer and QWeakPointer. The
    contents of the object pointed to by the pointer should not
    considered shared, however: there is only one object. For that
    reason, QSharedPointer does not provide a way to detach or make
    copies of the pointed object.

    QSharedDataPointer, on the other hand, holds a pointer to shared
    data (i.e., a class derived from QSharedData). It does so by means
    of an internal reference count, placed in the QSharedData base
    class. This class can, therefore, detach based on the type of
    access made to the data being guarded: if it's a non-const access,
    it creates a copy atomically for the operation to complete.

    QExplicitlySharedDataPointer behaves like QSharedDataPointer,
    except that it only detaches if
    QExplicitlySharedDataPointer::detach() is explicitly called.

    Finally, QPointer holds a pointer to a QObject-derived object, but
    it does so weakly. QPointer is similar, in that behaviour, to
    QWeakPointer: it does not allow you to prevent the object from
    being destroyed. All you can do is query whether it has been
    destroyed or not.

    \sa QSharedDataPointer, QWeakPointer

/*!
    \class QWeakPointer
    \brief The QWeakPointer class holds a weak reference to a shared pointer
    \since 4.5
    \reentrant
    \ingroup misc

    The QWeakPointer is an automatic weak reference to a
    pointer in C++. It cannot be used to dereference the pointer
    directly, but it can be used to verify if the pointer has been
    deleted or not in another context.

    QWeakPointer objects can only be created by assignment
    from a QSharedPointer.

    To access the pointer that QWeakPointer is tracking, you
    must first create a QSharedPointer object and verify if the pointer
    is null or not.

    \sa QSharedPointer
*/

/*!
    \fn QSharedPointer::QSharedPointer()

    Creates a QSharedPointer that points to null (0).
*/

/*!
    \fn QSharedPointer::~QSharedPointer()

    Destroys this QSharedPointer object. If it is the last reference to
    the pointer stored, this will delete the pointer as well.
*/

/*!
    \fn QSharedPointer::QSharedPointer(T *ptr)

    Creates a QSharedPointer that points to \a ptr. The pointer \a ptr
    becomes managed by this QSharedPointer and must not be passed to
    another QSharedPointer object or deleted outside this object.
*/

/*!
    \fn QSharedPointer::QSharedPointer(T *ptr, Deleter deleter)

    Creates a QSharedPointer that points to \a ptr. The pointer \a ptr
    becomes managed by this QSharedPointer and must not be passed to
    another QSharedPointer object or deleted outside this object.

    The \a deleter paramter specifies the custom deleter for this
    object. The custom deleter is called when the strong reference
    count drops to 0 instead of the operator delete(). This is useful,
    for instance, for calling deleteLater() in a QObject instead:

    \code
    static void doDeleteLater(MyObject *obj)
    {
        obj->deleteLater();
    }

    void otherFunction()
    {
        QSharedPointer<MyObject> obj =
            QSharedPointer<MyObject>(new MyObject, doDeleteLater);

        // continue using obj
        obj.clear();    // calls obj->deleteLater();
    }
    \endcode

    It is also possible to specify a member function directly, as in:
    \code
        QSharedPointer<MyObject> obj =
            QSharedPointer<MyObject>(new MyObject, &QObject::deleteLater);
    \endcode

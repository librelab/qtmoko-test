    \target The QDBus compiler

    \brief The QtDBus module is a Unix-only library that you can use
    to make Inter-Process Communication using the \l {Introduction to
    D-Bus} {D-Bus} protocol.

    Applications using the QtDBus module can provide services to
    other, remote applications by exporting objects, as well as use
    services exported by those applications by placing calls and
    accessing properties.

    The QtDBus module provides an interface that extends the Qt \l
    {signalsandslots.html}{Signals and Slots} mechanism, allowing one
    to connect to a signal emitted remotely as well as to connect a
    local signal to remote slot.

    To use this module, use the following code in your application:

    \snippet doc/src/snippets/code/doc_src_qtdbus.qdoc 0

    If you're using qmake to build your application, you can add this
    line to your .pro file to make it link against the QtDBus
    libraries:

    \snippet doc/src/snippets/code/doc_src_qtdbus.qdoc 1

    \note The source code for this module is located in the \c{src/qdbus}
    directory. When installing Qt from source, this module is built when Qt's
    tools are built.

    See the \l {Introduction to D-Bus} page for detailed information on
    how to use this module.

    This module is part of all \l{Qt editions}.

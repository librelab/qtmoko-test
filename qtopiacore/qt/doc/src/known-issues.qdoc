    \title Known Issues in %VERSION%
    \ingroup platform-notes
    \brief A summary of known issues in Qt %VERSION% at the time of release.

    An up-to-date list of known issues with Qt %VERSION% can be found via the
    \l{Task Tracker} on the Qt website which provides additional information
    about known issues and tasks related to Qt.

    \section1 General Issues

    When running Qt applications on Windows or with \c{-graphicssystem raster},
    any process that triggers a QWidget::update() from within a destructor
    might result in a crash.


    \section1 Issues with Third Party Software

    \section2 X11 Hardware Support

    \list
    \o  There is a bug in the 169.xx NVIDIA drivers on certain GeForce 8 series
        cards that is triggered by the OpenGL paint engine when using QPainter
        on a QGLWidget to draw paths and polygons. Some other painting
        operations that end up in the path fallback are affected as well. The
        bug causes the whole X server to repeatedly hang for several seconds at
        a time.
    \o  There is an issue with NVIDIA's 9xxx driver series on X11 that causes a
        crash in cases where there are several \l{QGLContext}s and the extended
        composition modes are used (the composition modes between and including
        QPainter::CompositionMode_Multiply and
        QPainter::CompositionMode_Exclusion). This affects the composition mode
        demo in Qt 4.5, for example. The crash does not occur in newer versions
        of the drivers.
    \endlist

    \section2 Windows Hardware Support

    \list
    \o  When using version 6.14.11.6921 of the NVIDIA drivers for the GeForce
        6600 GT under Windows XP, Qt applications which use drag and drop will
        display reduced size drag and drop icons when run alongside
        applications that use OpenGL. This problem can be worked around by
        reducing the level of graphics acceleration provided by the driver, or
        by disabling hardware acceleration completely.
    \endlist

    \section2 Windows Software Issues

    \list

    \o  When building Qt 4.5.0 with Windows 7, the build fails with an error
        message regarding failing to embed manifest. This a known issue with
        Windows 7, explained in the Windows 7 SDK Beta
        \l{http://download.microsoft.com/download/8/8/0/8808A472-6450-4723-9C87-977069714B27/ReleaseNotes.Htm}
        {release notes}. A workaround for this issue is to patch the
        \bold{embed_manifest_exe.prf} file with the following:

        \code
        diff --git a/mkspecs/features/win32/embed_manifest_exe.prf b/mkspecs/features/win32/embed_manifest_exe.prf
        index e1747f1..05f116e 100644
        --- a/mkspecs/features/win32/embed_manifest_exe.prf
        +++ b/mkspecs/features/win32/embed_manifest_exe.prf
        @@ -8,4 +8,9 @@ if(win32-msvc2005|win32-msvc2008):!equals(TEMPLATE_PREFIX, "vc"):equals(TEMPLATE
             QMAKE_POST_LINK = $$quote(mt.exe -nologo -manifest \"$$replace(OBJECTS_DIR,/,\\)\\$${NOPATH_TARGET}.intermediate.ma
        nifest\" -outputresource:$(DESTDIR_TARGET);1$$escape_expand(\n\t))
             QMAKE_POST_LINK += $$QMAKE_PREV_POST_LINK
             QMAKE_CLEAN += \"$$replace(OBJECTS_DIR,/,\\)\\$${NOPATH_TARGET}.intermediate.manifest\"
        +    isEmpty(RC_FILE) {
        +        system("echo.>$$replace(OUT_PWD,/,\\)\\$$replace(OBJECTS_DIR,/,\\)\\Windows7WorkAround.rc")
        +        RC_FILE = $$replace(OUT_PWD,/,\\)\\$$replace(OBJECTS_DIR,/,\\)\\Windows7WorkAround.rc
        +       }
        +
         }
        \endcode

    \o  Under certain circumstances Visual Studio Integration v1.4.0 will not
        be able to install the integration for Visual Studio 2005 on Windows
        Vista. An error message states that .NET Framework v2.0 Service Pack 1
        is not installed. This is due to a problem with the built-in
        installation of this on Windows Vista. This issue can be fixed by
        installing .NET Framework version 3.5.

    \o  With NVIDIA GeForce 7950 GT (driver version 6.14.11.7824), a fullscreen
        QGLWidget flickers when child widgets are shown/hidden. The workaround
        for this is to use \l{QWidget::}{setGeometry()} with a width/height 1
        pixel bigger than your geometry and call \l{QWidget::}{show()}.

    \o  A bug in the Firebird database can cause an application to crash when
        \c{fbembed.dll} is unloaded. The bug is fixed in version 2.5.

    \endlist

    \section2 Mac OS X Software Support

    \list
    \o  If a sheet is opened for a given window, clicking the title bar of that
        window will cause it to flash. This behavior has been reported to Apple
        (bug number 5827676).
    \endlist

    \title Qt for Embedded Linux
    \brief Documents specifically about Qt for Embedded Linux.

    Qt for Embedded Linux is a C++ framework for GUI and application development
    for embedded devices. It runs on a variety of processors, usually
    with Embedded Linux.  Qt for Embedded Linux provides the standard Qt API for
    embedded devices with a lightweight window system.

    Qt for Embedded Linux applications write directly to the framebuffer,
    eliminating the need for the X Window System and saving memory.
    The Linux framebuffer is enabled by default on all modern Linux
    distributions. For information on older versions, please refer to
    the \l{Framebuffer HOWTO} document. For development
    and debugging purposes, Qt for Embedded Linux provides a \l {The
    Virtual Framebuffer}{virtual framebuffer}. It is also possible to
    run an application using the
    \l{The VNC Protocol and Qt for Embedded Linux}{VNC protocol}.

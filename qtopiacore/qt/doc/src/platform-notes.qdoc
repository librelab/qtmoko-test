    \target AIX
    \section1 AIX - 5.2

    Qt has been tested on AIX 5.2, using the
    \l{Compiler Notes#IBM xlC (AIX)}{xlC} compiler.

    \table
    \header \o Compiler \o Notes
    \row    \o xlC
    \o If Qt is built correctly but all symbols are reported to be missing
    when you link an application, your makeC++SharedLib script might be out
    of date. Make sure you have the latest version from the
    \l{http://www-306.ibm.com/software/awdtools/vacpp/support/}{IBM website}.
    \row    \o GCC
    \o We have tested earlier versions of Qt 4 successfully with GCC version
    3.3 and above. Some versions of GCC may fail to link Qt with a "TOC overflow"
    message.
    Fix this by upgrading to the latest maintenance release of the dynamic
    linker. On AIX this is bos.rte.bind_cmds.4.1.5.3 or later.
    Some versions of GCC may fail to build Qt with STL and large-file support
    enabled, due to
    \l{http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=9551}{a bug in GCC}.
    Fix this by upgrading to the latest maintenance release of the compiler.
    It is also possible to work around this problem by running configure with
    either \c{-no-stl} or \c{-no-largefile}.
    \endtable

    \target FreeBSD
    \section1 FreeBSD - 6.0-RELEASE

    \note FreeBSD is a community supported platform. See the
    \l{Supported Platforms} page for more information.

    The system compiler on FreeBSD 4.x is gcc 2.95.4, which is not
    officially supported by Qt 4. We develop using and recommend
    ports/lang/gcc34. You will need to run configure with the
    \c{-platform freebsd-g++34} arguments. Optionally, you may use
    ports/lang/icc.

    The system compiler on FreeBSD 5.x and 6.x is GCC 3.4.4, which should be
    sufficient to build Qt. You do not need to add any special arguments when
    running configure. Optionally, you may use ports/lang/icc.

    Note that we do not actively test FreeBSD 4.x and 5.x. Our developers
    migrated to 6.x after the Qt 4 launch. FreeBSD-CURRENT is not supported.

    \target HP-UX
    \section1 HP-UX

    Qt supports HP-UX on both PA-RISC and the Itanium (IA64) architectures.

    \section2 PA-RISC - B.11.11 or later

    You can configure Qt for aCC in 32 and 64 bit mode (hpux-acc-64 or
    hpux-acc-32), or gcc in 32 bit mode (hpux-g++).  The default platform is
    hpux-acc-32. The minimum required version for aCC (HP ANSI C++) on PA-RISC
    is A.03.57. The supported gcc compiler is gcc 3.4.3.

    \section2 Itanium - B.11.23 or later

    You can configure Qt for aCC in 32 and 64 bit mode (hpuxi-acc-64 or
    hpuxi-acc-32). gcc is currently unsupported.  The default platform is
    hpuxi-acc-64. The minimum required version for aCC (HP ANSI C++) on
    Itanium is A.06.12.

    \section2 OpenGL Support

    Qt's \l{QtOpenGL}{OpenGL} module requires GLX 1.3 or later to be installed.
    This is available for HP-UX 11i - see the
    \l{http://docs.hp.com/en/5992-2331/ch04s02.html}{Graphics and Technical Computing Software}
    section of the release notes for more information.

    \target IRIX
    \section1 IRIX - 6.5.x

    \bold{IRIX is an unsupported platform - please see Qt's online
    \l{Platform Support Policy} for details.}

    Unpackaging and IRIX tar:
    Because of long filenames some files will be cut off incorrectly with IRIX
    tar. Please use GNU tar to unpack Qt packages.

    \section1 Linux

    There are no known problems with using Qt on production versions of
    Linux/x86, Linux/ppc, Linux/amd64 and Linux/ia64 (including Altix(R)).

    For the gcc/g++ compiler, please also see the relevant
    \l{Compiler Notes#GCC}{compiler page}.

    \section2 Installation problems

    See also the \l{Installation FAQ}.

    If you experience problems when installing new open source versions of Qt
    versions, try to use the open source Qt archives (e.g., RPM)
    provided by your Linux distribution. If you need to install the source (.tgz)
    archive, be aware that you will probably end up with two different
    versions of the Qt library installed on your system, which will probably
    lead to link errors, like this:
    \snippet doc/src/snippets/code/doc_src_platform-notes.qdoc 0
    Fix this by removing the old version of the library.

    If you have problems installing open source versions of Qt
    provided by your Linux distribution (e.g., RPM), please consult the
    maintainers of the distribution, not us.

    Some RPM versions have problems installing some of the Qt RPM archives
    where installation stops with an error message warning about a
    "Failed Dependency". Use the \c{--nodeps} option to \c rpm to workaround
    this problem.

    \target Solaris
    \section1 Solaris - 9 or later

    \section2 Unpackaging and Solaris tar

    On some Solaris systems, both Solaris tar and GNU tar have been reported
    to truncate long filenames. We recommend using star instead
    (http://star.berlios.de).

    \section2 CC on Solaris

    Be sure to check our \l{Compiler Notes#Sun Studio}{Forte Developer / Sun Studio}
    notes.

    \section2 GCC on Solaris

    Be sure to check the installation notes for \l{GCC on Solaris}.
    Do not use GCC with Sun's assembler/linker, this will result in link-time
    errors in shared libraries. Use GNU binutils instead. 

    GCC 3.2.* is known to miscompile Qt due to an optimizer bug that will
    cause the resulting binaries to hang. Please use GCC 3.4.2 or later.

    \section1 Windows Vista

    At the time Qt %VERSION% was released, there were no known Vista-specific issues.

    \target Windows NT
    \section1 Windows XP, Windows 2000 and Windows NT

    \section2 Installation location

    Installing Qt into a directory with spaces, e.g. C:\\Program Files, may
    cause linker errors like the following:
    \snippet doc/src/snippets/code/doc_src_platform-notes.qdoc 2

    Install Qt into a subdirectory without spaces to avoid this problem.

    \section2 AccelGALAXY graphic card

    When you use a NT 4.0 machine with the driver number
    4,00,1381,1000,021,4.0.0 there is a problem with drag an drop and icons.
    The computer freezes, and you have to reset. The problem disappears with
    the newest version of the driver, available at
    \l{http://www.es.com/}{www.es.com}.

    \section2 Possible GL conflict

    There is a known issue with running Microsoft NetMeeting, Lotus SameTime
    and other applications that require screen grabbing while direct
    rendering is enabled. Other GL-applications may not work as expected,
    unless direct rendering is disabled.

    \title Platform Notes - Mac OS X
    \contentspage Platform Notes

    This page contains information about the Mac OS X versions Qt is currently
    known to run on, with links to platform-specific notes. More information
    about the combinations of platforms and compilers supported by Qt can be
    found on the \l{Supported Platforms} page.

    \tableofcontents

    \section1 General Information

    Qt 4.4 and Qt 4.5 development is only supported on Mac OS X 10.4 and up.
    Applications built against these version of Qt can be deployed on Mac OS X
    10.3, but cannot be developed on that version of the operating system due
    to compiler issues.

    Qt 4.3 has been tested to run on Mac OS X 10.3.9 and up. See notes on
    the binary package for more information.

    Qt 4.1 has been tested to run on Mac OS X 10.2.8 and up. Qt 4.1.4 is the
    last release to work with Mac OS X 10.2.

    \section2 Required GCC version

    Apple's gcc 4 that is shipped with the Xcode Tools for both Mac OS X 10.4
    and 10.5 will compile Qt. There is preliminary support for gcc 4.2 which
    is included with Xcode Tools 3.1+ (configurable with
    \c{-platform macx-g++42}).

    \section2 Binary Package

    The binary package requires that you have your .qt-license file in your
    home directory. Installer.app cannot complete without a valid .qt-license
    file. Evaluation users of Qt will have information about how to create
    this file in the email they receive.

    The binary package was built on Mac OS X 10.4 with Xcode Tools 2.1
    (gcc 4.0.0) for Qt 4.1.0, Xcode Tools 2.2 (gcc 4.0.1) for Qt 4.1.1-4.1.4
    and Xcode Tools 2.3 for 4.2.0. It will only link executables built
    against 10.4 (or a 10.4 SDK). You should be able to run applications
    linked against these frameworks on Mac OS X 10.3.9 and Mac OS X 10.4+.
    If you require a different configuration, you will have to use the
    source package and build with GCC 3.3.

    \section2 Mac OS X on Intel hardware

    Qt 4 fully supports both the Intel and PowerPC architectures on the Mac.
    As of Qt 4.1 it is possible to support the Intel architecture by
    creating Universal Binaries with qmake. As of Qt 4.1 it is possible to
    build Qt as a set of universal binaries and frameworks from configure by
    adding these extra flags:

    \snippet doc/src/snippets/code/doc_src_platform-notes.qdoc 3

    If you are building on Intel hardware you can omit the sdk parameter, but
    PowerPC hardware requires it.

    You can also generate universal binaries using qmake. Simply add these
    lines to your .pro file:

    \snippet doc/src/snippets/code/doc_src_platform-notes.qdoc 4

    \section2 Build Issues

    If Qt does not build upon executing make, and fails with an error message
    such as

    \snippet doc/src/snippets/code/doc_src_platform-notes.qdoc 5

    this could be an indication you have upgraded your version of Mac OS X
    (e.g. 10.3 to 10.4), without upgrading your Developer Tools (Xcode Tools).
    These must match in order to successfully compile files.

    Please be sure to upgrade both simultaneously. If problems still occur,
    contact support.

    \section2 Fink

    If you have installed the Qt for X11 package from \l{Fink},
    it will set the QMAKESPEC environment variable to darwin-g++. This will
    cause problems when you build the Qt for Mac OS X package. To fix this, simply
    unset your QMAKESPEC or set it to macx-g++ before you run configure.
    You need to have a fresh Qt distribution (make confclean).

    \section2 MySQL and Mac OS X

    There seems to be a issue when both -prebind and -multi_module are
    defined when linking static C libraries into dynamic library. If you
    get the following error message when linking Qt:

    \snippet doc/src/snippets/code/doc_src_platform-notes.qdoc 6

    re-link Qt using -single_module. This is only a problem when building the
    MySQL driver into Qt. It does not affect plugins or static builds.

    \section2 Qt and Precompiled Headers (PCH)

    Starting with Qt 3.3.0 it is possible to use precompiled headers. They
    are not enabled by default as it appears that some versions of Apple's
    GCC and make have problems with this feature. If you want to use
    precompiled headers when building the Qt source package, specify the
    -pch option to configure. If, while using precompiled headers, you
    encounter an internal compile error, try removing the -include header
    statement from the compile line and trying again. If this solves the
    problem, it probably is a good idea to turn off precompiled headers.
    Also, consider filing a bug report with Apple so that they can
    improve support for this feature.

    \title Supported Platforms
    \brief The platforms supported by Nokia for Qt.
    \ingroup platform-notes

    Qt is supported on a variety of 32-bit and 64-bit platforms, and can
    usually be built on each platform with GCC, a vendor-supplied compiler, or
    a third party compiler. Although Qt may be built on a range of platform-compiler
    combinations, only a subset of these are actively supported by Qt.

    A more general overview of the platforms Qt runs on can be found on the
    \l{Platform Notes} page. Information about the compilers used on each platform
    can be found on the \l{Compiler Notes} page.

    \target GCC
    \section1 GCC

    \section2 GCC on Windows (MinGW)

    We have tested Qt with this compiler on Windows XP.
    The minimal version of MinGW supported is:

    \list
    \o GCC 3.4.2
    \o MinGW runtime 3.7
    \o win32api 3.2
    \o binutils 2.15.91
    \o mingw32-make 3.80.0-3
    \endlist

    \section2 GCC 4.0.0

    The released package of the compiler has some bugs that lead to miscompilations.
    We recommend using GCC 4.0.1 or later, or to use a recent CVS snapshot of the
    GCC 4.0 branch. The version of GCC 4.0.0 that is shipped with Mac OS X 10.4
    "Tiger" is known to work with Qt for Mac OS X.

    \section2 HP-UX

    The hpux-g++ platform is tested with GCC 3.4.4.

    \section2 Solaris

    Please use GCC 3.4.2 or later.

    \section2 Mac OS X

    Please use the latest GCC 3.3 from Apple or a later version of GCC 3.
    The gcc 3.3 that is provided with Xcode 1.5 is known to generate bad code.
    Use the November 2004 GCC 3.3 updater \l{http://connect.apple.com}{available from Apple}.

    \section2 GCC 3.4.6 (Debian 3.4.6-5) on AMD64 (x86_64)

    This compiler is known to miscompile some parts of Qt when doing a
    release build. There are several workarounds:

    \list 1
    \o Use a debug build instead.
    \o For each miscompilation encountered, recompile the file, removing the -O2 option.
    \o Add -fno-gcse to the QMAKE_CXXFLAGS_RELEASE.
    \endlist

    \section1 HP ANSI C++ (aCC)

    The hpux-acc-32 and hpux-acc-64 platforms are tested with aCC A.03.57. The
    hpuxi-acc-32 and hpuxi-acc-64 platforms are tested with aCC A.06.10.

    \section1 Intel C++ Compiler

    Qt supports the Intel C++ compiler on both Windows and Linux.
    However, there are a few issues on Linux (see the following
    section).

    \section2 Intel C++ Compiler for Linux

    Nokia currently tests the following compilers:

    \list

    \o Intel(R) C++ Compiler for applications running on IA-32,
    Version 10.1 Build 20080602 Package ID: l_cc_p_10.1.017

    \o Intel(R) C++ Compiler for applications running on Intel(R) 64,
    Version 10.1 Build 20080602 Package ID: l_cc_p_10.1.017

    \endlist

    We do not currently test the IA-64 (Itanium) compiler.

    \section2 Known Issues with Intel C++ Compiler for Linux

    \list

    \o Precompiled header support does not work in version 10.0.025
       and older. For these compilers, you should configure Qt with
       -no-pch. Precompiled header support works properly in version
       10.0.026 and later.
    \o Version 10.0.026 for Intel 64 is known to miscompile qmake when
       building in release mode. For now, configure Qt with
       -debug. Version 10.1.008 and later can compile qmake in release
       mode.
    \o Versions 10.1.008 to 10.1.015 for both IA-32 and Intel 64 are
       known crash with "(0): internal error: 0_47021" when compiling
       QtXmlPatterns, QtWebKit, and Designer in release mode. Version
       10.1.017 compiles these modules correctly in release mode.
    \endlist

    \section2 Intel C++ Compiler (Windows, Altix)

    Qt 4 has been tested successfully with:

    \list
    \o Windows - Intel(R) C++ Compiler for 32-bit applications,
       Version 8.1 Build 20050309Z Package ID: W_CC_PC_8.1.026
    \o Altix - Intel(R) C++ Itanium(R) Compiler for Itanium(R)-based
       applications Version 8.1 Build 20050406 Package ID: l_cc_pc_8.1.030
    \endlist

    We currently only test the Intel compiler on 32-bit Windows versions.

    \section1 MIPSpro (IRIX)

    \bold{IRIX is an unsupported platform. See the \l{Supported Platforms} page
    and Qt's online \l{Platform Support Policy} page for details.}

    Qt 4.4.x requires MIPSpro version 7.4.2m.

    Note that MIPSpro version 7.4.4m is currently not supported, since it has
    introduced a number of problems that have not yet been resolved.
    We recommend using 7.4.2m for Qt development. However, please note the
    unsupported status of this platform.

    \target Sun Studio
    \section1 Forte Developer / Sun Studio (Solaris)

    \section2 Sun Studio

    Qt is tested using Sun Studio 8 (Sun CC 5.5). Go to
    \l{Sun Studio Patches} page on Sun's Web site to download
    the latest patches for your Sun compiler.

    \section2 Sun WorkShop 5.0

    Sun WorkShop 5.0 is not supported with Qt 4.

    \section1 Visual Studio (Windows)

    We do most of our Windows development on Windows XP, using Microsoft
    Visual Studio .NET 2005 and Visual Studio 2008 (both the 32- and 64-bit
    versions).

    Qt works with the Standard Edition, the Professional Edition and Team
    System Edition of Visual Studio 2005.

    We also test Qt 4 on Windows XP with Visual Studio .NET and Visual Studio 2003.

    In order to use Qt with the Visual Studio 2005/2008 Express Edition you need
    to download and install the platform SDK. Due to limitations in the
    Express Edition it is not possible for us to install the Qt Visual
    Studio Integration. You will need to use our command line tools to
    build Qt applications with this edition.

    The Visual C++ Linker doesn't understand filenames with spaces (as in
    \c{C:\Program files\Qt\}) so you will have to move it to another place,
    or explicitly set the path yourself; for example:

    \snippet doc/src/snippets/code/doc_src_compiler-notes.qdoc 0

    If you are experiencing strange problems with using special flags that
    modify the alignment of structure and union members (such as \c{/Zp2})
    then you will need to recompile Qt with the flags set for the
    application as well.

    If you're using Visual Studio .NET (2002) Standard Edition, you should be
    using the Qt binary package provided, and not the source package.
    As the Standard Edition does not optimize compiled code, your compiled
    version of Qt would perform suboptimally with respect to speed.

    With Visual Studio 2005 Service Pack 1 a bug was introduced which
    causes Qt not to compile, this has been fixed with a hotfix available
    from Microsoft. See this
    \l{http://qt.nokia.com/developer/faqs/faq.2006-12-18.3281869860}{Knowledge Base entry}
    for more information.

    \section1 IBM xlC (AIX)

    The makeC++SharedLib utility must be in your PATH and be up to date to
    build shared libraries. From IBM's
    \l{http://www.redbooks.ibm.com/abstracts/sg245674.html}{C and C++ Application Development on AIX}
    Redbook:

    \list
    \o "The second step is to use the makeC++SharedLib command to create the
       shared object. The command has many optional arguments, but in its
       simplest form, can be used as follows:"
       \snippet doc/src/snippets/code/doc_src_compiler-notes.qdoc 1
    \o "The full path name to the command is not required; however, to avoid
       this, you will have to add the directory in which it is located to
       your PATH environment variable. The command is located in the
       /usr/vacpp/bin directory with the VisualAge C++ Professional for AIX,
       Version 5 compiler."
    \endlist

    \section2 VisualAge C++ for AIX, Version 6.0

    Make sure you have the
    \l{http://www-1.ibm.com/support/search.wss?rs=32&amp;tc=SSEP5D&amp;dc=D400}{latest upgrades}
    installed.

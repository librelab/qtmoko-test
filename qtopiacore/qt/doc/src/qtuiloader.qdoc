    \brief The QtUiTools module provides classes to handle forms created 
    with Qt Designer.

    These forms are processed at run-time to produce dynamically-generated
    user interfaces. In order to generate a form at run-time, a resource
    file containing a \c{.ui} file is needed. Applications that use the
    form handling classes need to be configured to be built against the
    QtUiTools module. This is done by including the following declaration
    in a \c qmake project file to ensure that the application is compiled
    and linked appropriately.

    \snippet doc/src/snippets/code/doc_src_qtuiloader.qdoc 0

    A form loader object, provided by the QUiLoader class, is used to
    construct the user interface. This user interface can
    be retrieved from any QIODevice; for example, a QFile object can be
    used to obtain a form stored in a project's resources. The
    QUiLoader::load() function takes the user interface description
    contained in the file and constructs the form widget.

    To include the definitions of the module's classes, use the following
    directive:

    \snippet doc/src/snippets/code/doc_src_qtuiloader.qdoc 1

    \note These classes are part of the \l{Open Source Versions of Qt} and
    \l{Qt Commercial Editions}{Qt Full Framework Edition} for commercial
    users.

    \title Qt for Embedded Platforms
    \brief Documents related to Qt for Embedded Platforms.

    Qt is available for embedded platforms and devices as well as for a number
    of desktop platforms. The features provided for each platform depend on the
    capabilities and architecture of the operating system.

    Currently, two embedded platforms are supported by Qt:

    \header
    \raw HTML
      <td style="width: 40%">Embedded Linux</td>
      <td style="background: white; width: 5%"></td>
      <td style="width: 40%">Windows CE</td>
    \endraw
    \row    \o \l{Qt for Embedded Linux} is designed to be used on Linux devices
               without X11 or existing graphical environments. This flavor of
               Qt includes a framework for creating both applications and an
               environment for them. As a result, it includes features for
               window management, inter-process communication and facilities
               for handling input and display devices.
    \raw HTML
      <td style="background: white; width: 5%"></td>
    \endraw
    \o \l{Qt for Windows CE} is used to create applications running in
               existing Windows CE and Windows Mobile environments.
               Applications use the appropriate style for the embedded
               environment and use native features, such as menus, to conform
               to the native style guidelines.

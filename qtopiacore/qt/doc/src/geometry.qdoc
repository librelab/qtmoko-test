    \title Window Geometry
    \ingroup architecture
    \brief An overview of window geometry handling and management.

    QWidget provides several functions that deal with a widget's
    geometry. Some of these functions operate on the pure client area
    (i.e. the window excluding the window frame), others include the
    window frame. The differentiation is done in a way that covers the
    most common usage transparently.

    \list
    \o \bold{Including the window frame:}
        \l{QWidget::x()}{x()},
        \l{QWidget::y()}{y()},
        \l{QWidget::frameGeometry()}{frameGeometry()},
        \l{QWidget::pos()}{pos()}, and
        \l{QWidget::move()}{move()}.
    \o \bold{Excluding the window frame:}
        \l{QWidget::geometry()}{geometry()},
        \l{QWidget::width()}{width()},
        \l{QWidget::height()}{height()},
        \l{QWidget::rect()}{rect()}, and
        \l{QWidget::size()}{size()}.
    \endlist

    Note that the distinction only matters for decorated top-level
    widgets. For all child widgets, the frame geometry is equal to the
    widget's client geometry.

    This diagram shows most of the functions in use:

    \section1 X11 Peculiarities

    On X11, a window does not have a frame until the window manager
    decorates it. This happens asynchronously at some point in time
    after calling QWidget::show() and the first paint event the
    window receives, or it does not happen at all. Bear in mind that
    X11 is policy-free (others call it flexible). Thus you cannot
    make any safe assumption about the decoration frame your window
    will get. Basic rule: There's always one user who uses a window
    manager that breaks your assumption, and who will complain to
    you.

    Furthermore, a toolkit cannot simply place windows on the screen. All
    Qt can do is to send certain hints to the window manager. The window
    manager, a separate process, may either obey, ignore or misunderstand
    them. Due to the partially unclear Inter-Client Communication
    Conventions Manual (ICCCM), window placement is handled quite
    differently in existing window managers.

    X11 provides no standard or easy way to get the frame geometry
    once the window is decorated. Qt solves this problem with nifty
    heuristics and clever code that works on a wide range of window
    managers that exist today. Don't be surprised if you find one
    where QWidget::frameGeometry() returns wrong results though.

    Nor does X11 provide a way to maximize a window.
    QWidget::showMaximized() has to emulate the feature. Its result
    depends on the result of QWidget::frameGeometry() and the
    capability of the window manager to do proper window placement,
    neither of which can be guaranteed.

    \section1 Restoring a Window's Geometry

    Since version 4.2, Qt provides functions that saves and restores a
    window's geometry and state for you. QWidget::saveGeometry()
    saves the window geometry and maximized/fullscreen state, while
    QWidget::restoreGeometry() restores it. The restore function also
    checks if the restored geometry is outside the available screen
    geometry, and modifies it as appropriate if it is.

    The rest of this document describes how to save and restore the 
    geometry using the geometry properties. On Windows, this is 
    basically storing the result of QWidget::geometry() and calling
    QWidget::setGeometry() in the next session before calling
    \l{QWidget::show()}{show()}. On X11, this won't work because an
    invisible window doesn't have a frame yet. The window manager
    will decorate the window later. When this happens, the window
    shifts towards the bottom/right corner of the screen depending on
    the size of the decoration frame. Although X provides a way to
    avoid this shift, most window managers fail to implement this
    feature.

    A workaround is to call \l{QWidget::setGeometry()}{setGeometry()}
    after \l{QWidget::show()}{show()}. This has the two disadvantages
    that the widget appears at a wrong place for a millisecond
    (results in flashing) and that currently only every second window
    manager gets it right. A safer solution is to store both
    \l{QWidget::pos()}{pos()} and \l{QWidget::size()}{size()} and to
    restore the geometry using \l{QWidget::resize()} and
    \l{QWidget::move()}{move()} before calling
    \l{QWidget::show()}{show()}, as demonstrated in the following
    code snippets (from the \l{mainwindows/application}{Application}
    example):

    \snippet examples/mainwindows/application/mainwindow.cpp 35
    \codeline
    \snippet examples/mainwindows/application/mainwindow.cpp 38

    This method works on Windows, Mac OS X, and most X11 window
    managers.

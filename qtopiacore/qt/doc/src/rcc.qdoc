    \keyword rcc

    The \c rcc tool is used to embed resources into a Qt application during
    the build process. It works by generating a C++ source file containing
    data specified in a Qt resource (.qrc) file.

    Usage:
    \snippet doc/src/snippets/code/doc_src_rcc.qdoc 0

    RCC accepts the following command line options:

    \table
    \header \o Option         \o Argument \o Description

    \row    \o \c{-o}         \o          \o Writes output to file rather than
                                             stdout.

    \row    \o \c{-name}      \o \c name  \o Creates an external initialization
                                             function with name.

    \row    \o \c{-threshold} \o \c level \o Specifies a threshold (in bytes)
                                             to use when compressing files. If
                                             the file is smaller than the
                                             threshold, it will not be
                                             compressed, independent of what
                                             the compression level is.
                                             
    \row    \o \c{-compress}  \o \c level \o Compresses input files with the
                                             given level. Level is an integer
                                             from 1 to 9 - 1 being the fastest,
                                             producing the least compression;
                                             9 being the slowest, producing
                                             the most compression.

    \row    \o \c{-root}      \o \c path  \o Prefixes the resource access path
                                             with root path.

    \row    \o \c{-no-compress} \o        \o Disables all compression.

    \row    \o \c{-binary}    \o          \o Outputs a binary file for use as
                                             a dynamic resource.

    \row    \o \c{-version}   \o          \o Displays version information.

    \row    \o \c{-help}      \o          \o Displays usage information.
    \endtable

Compling from sources
=====================

  * Download and install toolchain

cd /
sudo wget http://sourceforge.net/projects/qtmoko/files/qtmoko-debian-toolchain-armv4t-eabi.tar.gz/download
sudo tar xzvpf qtmoko-debian-toolchain-armv4t-eabi.tar.gz

  * If you are on x86_64 you will need to download following 32bit libraries:

libgmp3c2_XXX_i386.deb

     and extract the libraries from these package to /usr/lib32

  * Clone current git tree:

git clone git://github.com/radekp/qtmoko.git

  * Initialize and update submodules

cd qtmoko
git submodule init
git submodule update

  * Create build directory (you cant build from the git directory)

mkdir ../build
cd ../build

  * Build it:

../qtmoko/configure -device neo -D _FORTIFY_SOURCE=0 -rtti -confirm-license
make
make install

  * In case of errors you might try -force-build-qt argument.
